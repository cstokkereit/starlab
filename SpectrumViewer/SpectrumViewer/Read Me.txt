 You will need to install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 17.10.5 or later with C# Tools and Nuget Package Manager at least - may just come with it.
 
 I have created a skelton project with the correct output type, target .net/OS versions etc.
 
 You will need to use the Nuget Package Manager to install ScottPlot.WinForms 5.0.40 - Awsome graphing package - you may get some warnings about component compatibility but it still seems to work OK on my machine.
 
The data file is in the folder above this one and called lte03000-3.00+1.0.7 - had to delete 90% of it to get it below the 10Mb limt as I
did want to set up GitLFS

 I think the best thing to do first off is load the first two columns of the data files and write them out as rows in new delimted files - this will reduce the size and make importing the data easier. ScottPlot will accept
 separate arrays of x and y values so should be easy to load the converted files by spitting on the separator.
 
 The ScottPlot documentation is here - I have notriced some of the documentation seems to be out of date but they have just released a new version so it may be sorted now. give me a shout if any problems as I have a working chart
 using the latest code.

 Once you have generated a graph of the spectrum save it out as a png.
 
 Ultimately will want to select a range of files, do the conversion, import and png generation as a batch process.
 
 Have fun.
